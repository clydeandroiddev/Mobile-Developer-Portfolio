### VASK or Voters ASK Android and IOS App
(Store listing was removed after the Philippine Elections due to data privacy.)

VASK is a mobile application that helped onsite PPCRV volunteers assist voters during the May 2022 Philippine Elections. VASK helped volunteers search for the clustered precinct of voters within their assigned municipalities and voting centers. Aside from the exact search functionality, VASK allows you to specify particular voting centers to be in the scope of the search. It also provides a wildcard search on single of the voterâ€™s initials, a help module and a check connectivity module to check the connection details of the app during the initial download of the VASK database.
